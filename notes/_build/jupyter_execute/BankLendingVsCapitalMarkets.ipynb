    "It is well-known that cross-border capital flows can have destabilising consequences for local and global financial systems, illustrated through histories of financial crises in the 20th- and 21st -centuries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Asian Financial Crisis 1997-98 showed that countries running even modest fiscal and current account deficits - and no twin deficits at all, in the case of Singapore - be destabilised by sudden capital outflows quite divorced from any perceptible fundamentals aside from a latent notion of global 'risk-appetite'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, large volumes of capital inflows, whilst arising initially from seemingly imperceptible sources, lead to self-fulfilling circles of rising asset prices, and increased collateral values that fuel further borrowing and ultimately sow the seeds of a sudden reversal and a financial and currency crisis. This is at least partially the story of the Global Financial Crisis 2007-08 ('GFC').\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we suppose the term 'cross-border lending' fully encapsulates the anatomy of cross-border funding then we might miss an important story regarding the composition of this cross-border lending: namely, in the distinction between funding via cross-border bank lending ('CBL') and international debt securities ('IDS') issuance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, as BIS economists Torsten Ehlers, Bryan Hardy, and Patrick McGuire point out in an [article])(https://www.bis.org/publ/qtrpdf/r_qt2503f.htm) from the first quarterly review this year (although they were by no means the first to make this point), cross-border capital flows in the pre-GFC period consisted of a particularly high proportion of bank lending. Now, however, the authors note, cross-border credit is increasingly a phenomenon of international debt issuance.\n",

The rise but subsequent stagnation of cross-border bank lending in Developed Europe following the GFC is well-known.
